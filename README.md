## Deep-Learning-Projects/Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Introduction

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image recognition. Key steps and techniques used in this project include:

- Data Preprocessing - Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 images for input into the CNN model. This includes normalizing the pixel values and structuring the data.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture - Designing a CNN with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to effectively capture spatial hierarchies in images.
- Activation Functions - Using non-linear activation functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity in the model and enhance its learning capacity.
- Batch Normalization and Dropout - Applying batch normalization for faster convergence and dropout layers to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
- Model Training - Training the CNN on the CIFAR-10 training data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
- Evaluation Metrics - Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices to assess its classification ability.
- Data Augmentation - Enhancing the modelâ€™s generalization by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming on the images during training.
- Prediction and Visualization - Visualizing predictions made by the trained CNN on test data to observe the model's ability to correctly classify images.

This project highlights the power of CNNs in tackling image classification problems and demonstrates how to effectively implement a CNN for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
